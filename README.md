JSON Cleaner for gpt-crawler - https://github.com/GRL828/gpt-crawler

This script will process your JSON file, clean up its content, validate each entry, and then split the output into multiple files if it exceeds a certain size. Each output file will be a valid JSON file. Remember to replace 'Balders3-1.json', 'output', and 5 with your actual input file name, desired output file base name, and maximum file size in MB, respectively.
